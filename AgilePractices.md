Agile practices adopted by the team
------------------------------------

# Weekly standup meetings: 
Once in every week the team meets in the college to update everyone about the completed tasks and describes the challenges they are facing. This makes the team work more coordinated.This can be found in the agile pracitices - XP and SCRUM. The team does more SCRUM-way of following weekly meetings by asking the "three questions" in every meeting and reports the planned and completed tasks and also the challenges that are blocking further work. The task of reporting the weekly meeting minutes is rotated among the team members. 

# Backlog items:
The team derives and defines the backlog items from the user stories for every week. The status of each backlog item is updated on the task board. This helps in noting how much effort in time has been put for the backlog items.This can be found in the agile pracitices - KANBAN and SCRUM.

# Task board:
 The team uses the typical taskboard to track the progress of project. It reflects the statuses of backlog items. After every weekly meeting, the team updates the taskboard with new backlog items and assigns the respective team members who are supposed to work on it. This can be found in the agile practice - SCRUM.

# Definition of Done:
 The team agrees on a definition of done for every backlog item that is derived from the user story. With a clear definition of done the team can know for sure whether the backlog item adds value to the project or not. This can be found in the agile practices - KANBAN and SCRUM.

# Burndown chart:
 The team continously monitors and tracks the progress of the project by visually displaying the quantity of work that is done and the work that is yet to be done. This can be found only in the agile practice - SCRUM.
