## Online Books inventory:

The well known name in the online books inventory is Amazon. It is the largest online retailer.  
site: https://www.amazon.com/

There are also other online bookstores which are popular.
For example : http://www.powells.com/
              https://www.barnesandnoble.com/
              
There are some public data sets on books information that could be useful to our project:
For example:  http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/
              http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/craig-book-recommendations/books.txt

## Online Ice-cream inventory:

There are a couple online ice-cream ordering systems that take orders from customers and deliver ice-cream frozen right to their doorstep.
For example: https://shop.jenis.com/
             http://www.icecreamsource.com/             
The products here are quite proprietary. Therefore the types of ice creams may differ from one store to another. If we decide to develop the project in this domain, we may as well create a sample dataset to use.   

###In both domains, online cataloging and product recommendation has wide scope. Although, when considering datasets, a bookstore dataset size is substantially larger than that of ice-cream( due to limited number of ice-cream flavour, etc,.). Therefore, implementing a shopping cart for the bookstore domain has the inherent advantage of having to consider issues like scale, which are prevalent in real world applications.
