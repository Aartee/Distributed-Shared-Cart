WEEK #2:

The team members successfully researched the domain areas and arrived at a decision for choosing the domain of application in the online ordering system. Although each one of the team members invested in researching different domains of application for the last week, only one domain was chosen best discarding the rest. The team has also started designing the UI wireframes of the web application for which the probability of undergoing change is high.

WEEK #1:

Our team is well aware of the XP's "Let it evolve" approach towards project development. Key decisions during the first week of the project has been made keeping in mind that requirements can change any time. During the weekly meeting hours, all the team members courageously took up research topics which are totally new to them. The team defined the backlog items for the week considering that the tasks may be tossed over in the future if it no more adds any value to the project.
