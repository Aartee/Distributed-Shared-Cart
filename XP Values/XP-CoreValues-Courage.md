# Courage
WEEK #6:

This week the team discussed about integrating front end server with backend web application server. The designed REST API endpoints were lacking versioning in their URI. Some of the team members discussed and suggested to include vesioning in the URI. Therefore, the old URI was changed and updated with versioning.
========================================================================================================


WEEK #5:

The team worked on deploying different database clusters on aws. It is observed that some of the databases selected earlier are not feasible for clustering and partitioning. Therefore, the team had to change over to MongoDB for better clustering features. The team also worked on back end code by designing APIs for integrating different microservices.  
=========================================================================================================

WEEK #4:

This week the team members decided upon the programming language for developing the project. Python is new for most of the team members, yet they have started working on the project, exploring and learning the new language. The team members have been exploring available database services for user sessions, financial data, shopping cart, etc. some of the database choices have been changed.
=========================================================================================================


WEEK #3:

This week all the team members thoroughly researched independent modules on a more fundamental level and made their choice for backend data services. Although at this point, the choices that are made seems to be fair enough but there is always a risk of technical debt. Therefore, in order to proceed with the system implementation, the team has made a strong mind to go ahead with the available options at hand and face the consequences when it arises.
===========================================================================================================


WEEK #2:

The team members successfully researched the domain areas and arrived at a decision for choosing the domain of application in the online ordering system. Although each one of the team members invested in researching different domains of application for the last week, only one domain was chosen best discarding the rest. The team has also started designing the UI wireframes of the web application for which the probability of undergoing change is high.
===========================================================================================================

WEEK #1:

Our team is well aware of the XP's "Let it evolve" approach towards project development. Key decisions during the first week of the project has been made keeping in mind that requirements can change any time. During the weekly meeting hours, all the team members courageously took up research topics which are totally new to them. The team defined the backlog items for the week considering that the tasks may be tossed over in the future if it no more adds any value to the project.  
===========================================================================================================

Personal Project Log to report on a weekly basis on how the team kept this value throughout the project.
