"Feedback" is very important for successful project deliveries. It should be taken constantly in the entire software development life cycle. 

There are three types of feedback in software development:
  
## 1. Feedback from system : 
 Writing and running unit tests regularly on the code gives a feedback from the system to the developer.

## 2. Feedback from Customer : 
 Giving regular demo of the iterations to the customer gets a concrete feedback from the customer channeling the development in the right direction.

## 3. Feedback from Team : 
 Communicating regularly among the team can help in finding flaws in the product early and can help the team plan development more efficiently.


# Week #1

We had regular meetings and discussions among the team members. For a healthy, efficient discussion, it is very important that we express our opinions freely and clearly. All the discussions had full participation from all the team members. In selecting the domains for the project, everybody provided their opinion. Every team member's opinion was considered and discussed upon. Discussing and expressing views helped us understand the requirements and corrected our misconceptions about the project requirements. Getting feedback from every team member helped us create tasks, divide XP core values, divide data domains and project deliverables unanimously.

# Week #2

We had three research tasks on six different domains last week to find if real time data is available for the domain to check for the feasibility of the domains. The three team members responsible for those tasks updated their findings, useful links and their conclusion in the GitHub repository. In the team meeting, all the team members gave their feedback on the research findings of the three tasks. The feedback of every team member was taken into consideration and discussed upon to come up with one final domain to be used in the project.

Similarly, we had a task to research and study for the feasibility of the front-end technologies available. The findings and conclusions of the task were discussed and everybody gave feedback on the conclusions.

This week, I worked on the UI wireframes for login and register screen. I got my designs reviewed by my team, got their feedback, worked on the changes and then uploaded the UI designs in the GitHub repository.

It's very important to get timely feedback from the team and the customer on the progress of the tasks to make sure that there is no wastage of time or efforts and to find bugs early.
  
  
# Week #3
  
In the team meeting, We discussed on the database reasearch we all conducted in our data domains. We took feedback from each other on our research observations and conclusions. This helped us think on what we need to do next - continue research or finalize a database for the domain.  Also, for the UI wireframes, I created two screens to show navigation menu before user logs in. After getting feedback from my team members, I realized I had missed out on adding catalog option in the menu. So, I made the required changes. Getting timely feedbacks from team members helps us eliminate any non-required tasks we are working on and helps us re-organize our tasks better.
