**Week#1 : 17/09 - 23/09**

Small modules in the project combine together to create the entire project. Each module would be implemented 
on different technology depending on the member implementing the module.

Combining all the modules and optimizing them to see it as a whole would need optimization of each unit of 
the project which includes ideas and their implementation. This would overall improve the whole project.

Since we started the project discussion with the group with a decent pace, we were able to picturize things 
by end of the week. Each oneâ€™s tasks were discussed with other members and after collecting feedback, we tried 
implementing that. Checking on everyone for completion of their intended tasks and discussing in case of any concerns 
so that we can always represent every work in a team as a whole.

**Week#2 : 24/09 - 30/09**

Even if each team member has started working on the small modules like shopping cart, product catalog, user activity logs, 
everyone has explained whatever they have done to each team member for getting the overall progress of the project. 
Also, if someone needs any help in between everyone is so helpful to get that done.

To see the whole with respect to the project, we have made major decisions on the domain of shopping cart, got real 
time data for that domain, finalized front-end technology and started researching on the back-end technology such as 
NoSQL databases for sub-modules(Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, User Sessions, User Activity Logs and Financial Data).


**Week#3 : 01/10 - 07/10**

This week each team member has done research on the backend service independently. While doing study of the backend services like NoSQL databases, scalability, etc. everyone has made simple choices so that it will be, as a whole, easy to develop and deliver in real time. 

Overall, everyone has explained their study topic to each other at high level.In this way everyone has the picture in mind what others have studied and found. While doing this, everyone found its simple to understand since most of the backend services are interlinked with each other.

**Week#4 : 15/10 - 21/10**

As a whole, in this week everyone has worked on backend part of the sub-modules like product catalogs, shopping cart, user activity logs, etc. Evryone has explored the NoSql databases suitable for the assigned sub-modules and make local connection to those databases.

Also, while working on the sub-modules, each team member has idea of how others are going worward with there sub-modules so that it will be easy to integrate all sub-modules as a whole.
