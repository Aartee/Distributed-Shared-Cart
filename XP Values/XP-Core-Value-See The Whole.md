**Week#1 : 17/09 - 23/09**

Small modules in the project combine together to create the entire project. Each module would be implemented 
on different technology depending on the member implementing the module.

Combining all the modules and optimizing them to see it as a whole would need optimization of each unit of 
the project which includes ideas and their implementation. This would overall improve the whole project.

Since we started the project discussion with the group with a decent pace, we were able to picturize things 
by end of the week. Each oneâ€™s tasks were discussed with other members and after collecting feedback, we tried 
implementing that. Checking on everyone for completion of their intended tasks and discussing in case of any concerns 
so that we can always represent every work in a team as a whole.

**Week#2 : 24/09 - 30/09**

Even if each team member has started working on the small modules like shopping cart, product catalog, user activity logs, 
everyone has explained whatever they have done to each team member for getting the overall progress of the project. 
Also, if someone needs any help in between everyone is so helpful to get that done.

To see the whole with respect to the project, we have made major decisions on the domain of shopping cart, got real 
time data for that domain, finalized front-end technology and started researching on the back-end technology such as 
NoSQL databases for sub-modules(Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, User Sessions, User Activity Logs and Financial Data).
