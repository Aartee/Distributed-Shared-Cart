**Week#1 : 17/09 - 23/09**

Small modules in the project combine together to create the entire project. Each module would be implemented 
on different technology depending on the member implementing the module.

Combining all the modules and optimizing them to see it as a whole would need optimization of each unit of 
the project which includes ideas and their implementation. This would overall improve the whole project.

Since we started the project discussion with the group with a decent pace, we were able to picturize things 
by end of the week. Each oneâ€™s tasks were discussed with other members and after collecting feedback, we tried 
implementing that. Checking on everyone for completion of their intended tasks and discussing in case of any concerns 
so that we can always represent every work in a team as a whole.

**Week#2 : 24/09 - 30/09**

Even if each team member has started working on the small modules like shopping cart, product catalog, user activity logs, 
everyone has explained whatever they have done to each team member for getting the overall progress of the project. 
Also, if someone needs any help in between everyone is so helpful to get that done.

To see the whole with respect to the project, we have made major decisions on the domain of shopping cart, got real 
time data for that domain, finalized front-end technology and started researching on the back-end technology such as 
NoSQL databases for sub-modules(Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, User Sessions, User Activity Logs and Financial Data).


**Week#3 : 01/10 - 07/10**

This week each team member has done research on the backend service independently. While doing study of the backend services like NoSQL databases, scalability, etc. everyone has made simple choices so that it will be, as a whole, easy to develop and deliver in real time. 

Overall, everyone has explained their study topic to each other at high level.In this way everyone has the picture in mind what others have studied and found. While doing this, everyone found its simple to understand since most of the backend services are interlinked with each other.

**Week#4 : 15/10 - 21/10**

As a whole, in this week everyone has worked on backend part of the sub-modules like product catalogs, shopping cart, user activity logs, etc. Evryone has explored the NoSql databases suitable for the assigned sub-modules and make local connection to those databases.

Also, while working on the sub-modules, each team member has idea of how others are going worward with there sub-modules so that it will be easy to integrate all sub-modules as a whole.

**Week#5 : 22/10 - 28/10**

Everyone has created the REST apis for respective sub-modules' functionalities in python. While designing the REST api for particular sub-module everyone has kept the similar format so that it will be easy to integrate as a whole.

Some team members has worked on the frontend to see the proof of concept which will make development easy in a bigger picture. As a whole, to integrate all modules everyone has researched on how to create cluster for each sub-module's databases in the AWS account.

**Week#6 : 29/10 - 04/11**

As a whole, this week everyone has written the REST apis for the individual's sub-modules in the Python. Also, some of us has created the cluster of database for the sub-module such that it will be easy to test the partition tolerance functoinality.
Also, everyone is in process to draw various UML diagrams for the book-store.

To see in a bigger picture, in this week everyone has done with writing the REST apis for sub-modules. Integration part will be done in the next week. 

**Week#7 : 05/11 - 11/11**

In this week everyone has started integrating their module's REST api's server with the front end code. While doing this, everyone has made sure that everyone will follow the similar pattern for writing the REST api, front end logic so that it will be easy to interact between each modules with each other in the same way. And as a whole it will make an unified way for the entire book store.

To see in a bigger picture, in this week everyone has done itegration for individuals' sub-modules including front end, REST apis, database in the cluster. The whole system's integration will be done in the next week. 

**Week#8 : 12/11 - 18/11**

As a whole in this week evryone has worked on integration part of the whole system. Everyone has integraed the server code with the front end code as well as the cluster of the mongodb databases. Also, each team member has created the UML diagrams for the project.
