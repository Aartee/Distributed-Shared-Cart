Week #4

This week two of the teammates have migrated their NoSQL databases from Riak to DynamoDB and from DynamoDB to Redis. Other people respected the change. Also, this week, we were to decide on the programming language to use for the backend code. We came up with three options namely: go, python and Java. Most of use were inclined to using Go or python as they are very easy to use. But, none of us have worked on Go before and 3 of us have experience in writing code in python. So we decided to use Python for the server side code. Everyone agreed upon this and the others who don't have experience with either language respected the choice. 

Week #3

This week we were looking to finalize the NoSQL databases for the application, but couldn't finalize it. Everyone is not sure about the databases they are planning to use. We all are considering the trade-off between the available NoSQL databases which is causing a delay in project development.

Even though delay is caused we respect everyone's opinion about the delay. This will be helpful in later stages of the project as there won't be mid-project issues with databases changes.

Week #2

This week the Domain of the project was finalized from the 6 available options. It was boiled down to one and we finally decided to go with: Multi-user Online Book Shopping cart service. Though this was not the choice for most of the team members to begin with, everyone measured it's pros and cons and discussed them. The team members respected each other's perspective about the domain and finally settled with it being the domain.

Also, the front end technology to be used was also finalized and Angular JS was chosen. This was an easy choice since lot of team members do not have experience developing the front end. Those who have previous knowledge with front end gave their opinion and the other team members respected their opinion and decided to go with it.

Everyone respects the choice of responsibilities given to each team member during the weekly meeting and also the authority over our own work.

Week #1

Each team member is new to team. Everyone's should give and feel the respect they deserve as a team member. Each member of my team contributed to suggestions and ideas regarding the project. In turn each one respected others opinions also.

During team discussions, we had a lot of ideas coming up from every member. Each one was given opportunity to speak and their ideas where taken into consideration for analyzing pros and cons. We may be wrong in presenting our ideas but each one should maintain esteem and correct the member.

We had conversations regarding start of the project and all ideas the were noted down. We are analyzing each others perspective and then we will select on the process and architecture to be designed
