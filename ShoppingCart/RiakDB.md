Riak is a distributed NoSQL key-value data store which provides high availability, scalability, simplicity and fault tolerance. It has a fault tolerance data replication and automatic data distribution across the cluster for performance. 

Riak being a NoSQL database matches the requirement for the choice of database I'm looking for, to implement the shopping cart module.
It is based on CAP Theorem and focus on Availability and Partition Tolerance, and hence it is also suitable for demonstration of Partition Tolerance of System.

Thus wih above details it shows me that it is a suitable choice of database for the project. But the feasibility for using it for shopping cart module is still not clear.
