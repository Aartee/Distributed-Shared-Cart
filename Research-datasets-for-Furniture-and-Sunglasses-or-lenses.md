We will be building a cloud scale multi-user shopping cart Service on Amazon Cloud and Google Cloud as our CMPE-281 Cloud Scale SaaS Team Project. We have discussed upon 6 domains for this project and need to finalize on one for our project. For any domain we choose, we will need a database to store the shopping store catalog data.

For our project, we have discussed the data we need for each of the 6 domains and have decided to use real time data(if possible). Real time data makes the project more realistic than having sample dummy data. Real time datasets are not available easily. So, we have divided the domains among ourselves and are researching to find if real time data is available for the domains we have.
