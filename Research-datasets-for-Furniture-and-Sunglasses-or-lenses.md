# Issue #5 : Study and research shopping cart domains (Furniture store, Lens/Sunglasses/Eyewear)
(https://github.com/nguyensjsu/cmpe281-avengers/issues/5)

We will be building a cloud scale multi-user shopping cart Service on Amazon Cloud and Google Cloud as our CMPE-281 Cloud Scale SaaS Team Project. We have discussed upon 6 domains for this project and need to finalize on one for our project. For any domain we choose, we will need a database to store the shopping store catalog data.

For our project, we have discussed the data we need for each of the 6 domains and have decided to use real time data(if possible). Real time data makes the project more realistic than having sample dummy data. Real time datasets are not available easily. So, we have divided the domains among ourselves and are researching to find if real time data is available for the domains we have. 


Below are some links I came across for finding real time data:

# 1. Furniture:

There is not much real time data available online for furniture. Most of the databases i found had the data of all furniture stores, their websites, contact numbers and other details. 

I researched through some of the furniture catalogs. Below are the some of the links for the catalogs and datasets found:

 i. https://info.ikea-usa.com/Catalog/  
 ii. http://www.odditysoftware.com/page-datasales42.htm#DOWNLOAD_SAMPLE  
 iii. http://ikea.csail.mit.edu/  
 iv. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vmr/datasets/ikea_kitchen/  
 v. http://www.livingspaces.com/inspiration/catalog  
 vi. https://www.foagroup.com/catalog/files/assets/basic-html/index.html#I  

# 2. Eyewear/Sunglasses/Lenses:

I could not find any real time dataset that we can use by importing in our project directly. Below are the links of some of the catalogs i could find which can be helpful:

 i. http://www.lenscrafters.com/lc-us/eyewear-all  
 ii. http://www.nikevision.com/  
 iii. http://www.sunglasshut.com/  
  
  
  
# Conclusion:

Based on my research, I think these two domains would not be feasible to use in our team project. The data we use is equally important as the other aspects of the project. If we use any of these domains we will have to go through a catalog and manually add data to the database which is time consuming and not efficient.
