WEEK #1 17/09 - 23/09

Effective communication is an integral part of any collaborative work. Since this is the very beginning of our project, we need to exchange our thoughts and ideas needed to build this project. Each member barely knows each other and so, each one needs to speak up what's in their mind.
We met in library after class to know each other by talking and allowing each one to be comfortable in opening up and present their ideas later. We adopted different means for communicating with one another, made whatsapp group for instant discussion of ideas and a google document where each one jot down their ideas and thoughts.
After a couple of days, we had a google document with all research and thoughts that each one had conducted. We kept conference calls each day at 9:00 pm to discuss the daily tasks and if anyone had any doubts that needed to be discussed. Each one was provided the freedom and opportunity to speak.
This is now we started interacting within the team. We are coming up with more ways to exchange ideas and thoughts efficiently.

WEEK #2 - 23/09 30/09

This week we proceeded further with the issues faced and discussing the work being done. Since regular communication is important for successful accomplishment, he conducted daily conference calls on hangout to discuss - "what has been done", "what we need to do" and "what issues were faced".
These questions made the flow easier and convenient to address all issues. Each member participated actively in the discussion and provided suggestions to others issues and ideas. Later we also, had a meet in library to record the progress and talk face to face.
We stepped further by deciding the domain of the shopping cart. Many things where ambiguous when we started discussing further. We needed more clarity. Each one gave inputs and whatever they could think of. We worked on the specific tasks and continued.
