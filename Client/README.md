# How to run on local  
  
If you try to open the html pages directly in the browser you might run into CORS issues. To avoid this follow the following steps to run a HTTP server locally.  
1. npm install http-server -g
2. Navigate to Client folder.
3. Run command - python -m http.server
4. Open in browser: http://localhost:8000/views/register.html
