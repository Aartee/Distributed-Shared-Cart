**Week#1 : 17/09 - 23/09**

Anything we create or develop is useful only if its understandable to everyone. Simplicity is hence key to all 
implementations. Complex thoughts and ideas can be broken into small units and simplified and implemented. This 
makes the content easy and comprehensive to interpret. 

This is the first week of the project and we have just begun discussing on the roles, task of each member, 
responsibilities, the technologies that can be used, alternate solutions, design and architecture and others. 
Whatever the idea may be, we shall put in effort to keep each unit simple and easy to interpret. 

The unnecessary elements need to be removed so that the necessary elements of the work get highlighted which 
involves the ability to simplify them. Simplicity leads to greater appreciation since it helps us to reduce the 
problem and uncover an innovation solution.

**Week#2 : 24/09 - 30/09**

In this week our team has shown the simplicity(XP core value) by deciding the simple domain for online shopping. 
While choosing the domain amongst various domains, we have focused on how the domain can be kept simple so that it 
will be easy to access to the customers and easy to develop the cloud-scalable shopping cart as well.

Also, after deciding the domain we gave our thought on how can we design the simple front-end for the customers. 
In that we first came up with the simple SignIn and SignUp UI page designs as provided in the UI Wireframes.
Henceforth, Simplicity is the key of our front-end and back-end design architecture and development.
