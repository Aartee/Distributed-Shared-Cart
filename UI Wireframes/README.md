This folder consists all the UI wireframes for the user interface of the project. 

The UI wireframes are designed using Pencil software. 
Hence, there are two types of files for every screen :
1. .ep file which can be opened only in Pencil.
2. .png file which is an image format of the UI wireframes.

**Please Note** : The images and names used in the UI wireframes and not final. They are just used as a sample to convey the UI design.
