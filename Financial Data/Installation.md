Installing PyMongo, The Python MongoDb Connector

Assuming that you have python 2.7 already installed in the system, we will start by installing PIP, the python package management system. Type in the following command on terminal to install pip :
"sudo apt-get install python-pip"

Once PIP has been installed, type in the following command to install PyMongo :
"sudo pip install pymongo"

Now we are ready to connect to MongoDb using Python.

Install Flask using PIP python package manager :
"sudo pip install flask"

#Install Flask fabric dependency
"sudo pip install fabric"
